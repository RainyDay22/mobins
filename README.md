An intial attempt at writing an Android Interface for [Mobile Insight] (https://github.com/mobile-insight/mobileinsight-core/tree/ubuntu22-py310) using the JetPack Compose framework.

Currently, it is a very limited console (a textbox that grows each time the "hit me" button is pressed). Reset is buggy due to complications of reconfiguration.
Built on the basis of the Dice tutorial from Android Developers Jetpack Compose pages.

[Progress Log] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-k_vyEV0uJZaQlWFTPza41hrtdz6_tOiAE4RHVpCcKQ/edit?usp=sharing) include information for the Chaquopy buildwheel and up to date efforts.
